### How to Use YT Video Downloader

Using this app is super simple; as easy as 1, 2, 3! 

First, you need to copy the URL from a Youtube page that you'd like to download into the first entry box right below the header. 

Then, you need to select the type of link (video, playlist, channel) by clicking 1 of 3 boxes below the entry box. 

Lastly, you need to press the big button that says 'Start' and watch as the program downloads the video(s)!
